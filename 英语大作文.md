​		It is apparent that the chart records the numbers of volunteer groups and volunteers in China from 2016 to 2020. During these years, the numbers of volunteer groups and volunteers have witnessed some changes. Especially, the numbers of volunteers has been on the rise, significantly(adv. 有重大意义地，显著地) growing from 32.8 million to 192.0 million over five years. Obviously, the tendency should be given more consideration.

​		Several primary causes（原因） account for the situation. But for my part, the following two are the most important. One factor that plays a vital role is that people have realized that participating in volunteer activities helps them promote personal growth and self-esteem（n. 自尊心）. It is also due to the fact that through voluntary work, people can discover their hidden talents and thus may change their perceptions(n. 看法，见解) of self-worth(n. 自我价值感).

​		Taking into account what has been discussed above, we may safety come to the conclusion that the tendency will continue in the years to come, It is high time for people to raise their awareness in this aspect.
