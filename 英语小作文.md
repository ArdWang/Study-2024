Dear Friend,

​			I am writing this letter to you to express my gratitude for your invitation. And I am glad to participate in the debate with you.

​			My plan is as follows. Firstly, it is advisable for us to draft our individual speeches first so that we both can have enough time to write our own list of arguments and evidence. Secondly, it would be beneficial if we could fix a time to discuss all the speeches together to decide which arguments are the most persuasive.

​			Once again, thank you very much for your invitation. I am looking forward to your reply.
