For one thing, there will be some well-know doctors and health experts giving speeches in the lecture , so I believe that you can learn a lot of health knowledge. For author, it helps to clear up your confusion about how to live a healthy life because the lecture includes a question and answer session.

Suppose one of your classmates has invited you to participate in a debate with him. Write a reply to accept the invitation, and tell him/her your plan.

You should write about 100 words on the ANSWER SHEET.

Do not use your own name. Use "Li Ming" instead.

Do not write your address.(10 ponits)



Dear Friend,

​			I am writing this letter to you to express my gratitude for your invitation. And I am glad to participate in the debate with you.

​			My plan is as follows. Firstly, it is advisable for us to draft our individual speeches first so that we both can have enough time to write our own list of arguments and evidence. Secondly, it would be beneficial if we could fix a time to discuss all the speeches together to decide which arguments are the most persuasive.

​			Once again, thank you very much for your invitation. I am looking forward to your reply.

​																																					Sincerely yours,

​																																							Li Ming
