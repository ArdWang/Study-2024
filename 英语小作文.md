Dear Friends,

​			I am writing this e-mail to you to recommend a health lecture which will be held in the lecture hall at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.

​			The primary reasons are as follows. For one thing, there will be some well-know doctors and health experts giving speeches in the lecture , so I believe that you can learn a lot of health knowledge. For author, it helps to clear up your confusion about how to live a healthy life because the lecture includes a question and answer session.

​			I sincerely hope that my recommendation can draw your attention.

​																																				Sincerely yours,

​																																						Li Ming
